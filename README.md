# Telos

This project is one of the first I built using the MERN stack and reflects my earliest (rookie) thinking. 

It is a task management application built with Material-UI components, react-beautiful-dnd, and fully functioning user authentication with json web tokens.

Users can register/login, create and assign categories to their tasks, schedule and prioritize by date, and analyze progress based on completed tasks. 

Future iterations of this project will contain Redux for managing user auth, filtering functions for managing the task arrays, modularized components, far fewer api calls, and a React Native version. 

The working project can be found deployed on AWS here: http://3.135.223.144/
